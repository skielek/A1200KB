These are my modifications to the rev4 design. I've made the following changes:

- Corrected the exposed soldermask issues
- Updated the caps-lock footprint to move the LED from bottom to top
- Re-routed the caps-lock traces
- Removed text for cleaner aesthetic

I've also used KiCad 6 (original design used 5.x), so be aware as these won't load in an older version.

And I've provided a zip containing all the necessary files for PCBWay.
