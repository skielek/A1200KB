This rev 4b contains a few additional updates over the 4a, namely:

- Modified all switch footprints to move the minimal switch outline and key labels to the silkscreen
- Cleaned up some of the key labels and thier positions to be consistent
- Added an Amiga logo to the front silkscreen
- Added identifier for this revision to the back silkscreen along with credit to Adam for his awesome work!

And again, included a zip containing gerbers for PCBWay. If you simply want to get some boards made from PCBWay, then all you need is that zip file and an account with PCBWay. This design should pass their QE with no questions or issues. Bear in mind that they do minimum quantity of 5. So you may want to use someone else if you only want a single board. Or do a group buy with some friends! Cost for 5 is around $90 USD + shipping.

Board size is 450 x 125 mm

Here's what the board looks like in white soldermask with black silkscreen
